* [ ] The Async Problem
* [ ] Callbacks
* [ ] Promises

## Why do we use Callbacks?

* Re-usability / Modularity
* Code organization
* Asynchronous Tasks (Running out-of-order code)

## High Order?

* Can have a callback (as a parameter)
* Return a function

## Promises also help us Solve the Async Problem

We want ways in programming, to ensure that functionality has completed before moving on to a subsequent step.

A promise is an object of class "Promise."

Promises have 3 states...

1. Pending
2. Resolved (Success)
3. Rejected (Failure / Error)
